  <h3>initial commit</h3>
  <h5>feb. 21, 2019</h5>
  <br>
  <i>'initial commit'</i> is the idiomatic message that marks the release of a new project on <code>git</code> â€” it's a project's 'hello, world'.<br>
  <br>
  it's a horrifying line. your initial commit is the first time you're showing your work to the world, with every line, space, and comment recorded and archived. what if i missed a mistake? what if i didn't test it enough? what if i was too excited to just *finish* and left out something important?<br>
  <br>
  i've committed, deleted, and recommitted this website many times, under many different names, and i'm getting closer to making something i want to keep.<br>
  <br>
  as i write this, this project sucks. it's ugly and poorly formatted; it has no coherent plan; i don't want you to look at it. i want everything to be my own work: the design, the backend it's running on, the server that's hosting it â€” but if i spent the time to implement all of that then i wouldn't be writing this now. and would you feel like you're getting to know me because your computer is running my code?<br>
  <br>
  i want you to feel like you are, so i'll start with stream-of-consciousness notes like this that get rid of the blank space.<br>
  <br>
  i'm putting this on the internet to be a supplement to my rÃ©sumÃ© and to encourage me to keep doing interesting things that i can talk about.<br>
  <br>
  here's the first one:<br>
  <br>
  <code>git commit -am "initial commit"</code>
